Here's a summary of the requirements, broken down for clarity:Core Functionality:Price and Quantity Tracking:Users (including Garvey and delegated users) need to input lubricant prices and quantities.Store Management:Garvey needs to be able to add/manage the stores being tracked.Product Volume ManagementGarvey needs to define and manage the volume ranges of the products (e.g., 200ml, 500ml, 750ml).User Management:Garvey needs an admin site to:Create separate user accounts (via email).Delegate data input responsibilities to those users.Dashboard (Garvey-Specific):Data Visualization:Tables of the collected price and quantity data.Graphs of the data (types not specified, but could include trends, comparisons, etc.).Map of the stores being tracked.Data Filtering:Filter data by: store, price, product, location.User Activity Tracking:Record every user login to their dashboard.Key User Roles:Garvey (Admin):Full access to everything: dashboard, admin site, data input, store management, user management, product volume management.Delegated Users:Limited access: data input (prices and quantities) for assigned stores, their own dashboard.Technology Considerations (Initial Thoughts):Backend: A robust framework like Django (Python) or Laravel (PHP) would be suitable. These provide user authentication, database management, and tools for building admin interfaces.Database: A relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL is ideal for storing the structured data (stores, products, prices, quantities, users).Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface. A JavaScript framework (React, Vue.js) could be beneficial for building the interactive dashboard.Mapping: A library like Leaflet (JavaScript) can be used to display the stores on a map.Graphing: A JavaScript charting library like Chart.js or D3.js can be used to create the data visualizations.Next Steps:To move forward, we need to define:Data Models: A detailed schema for the database (tables, columns, relationships).User Authentication and Authorization: How users will log in and what permissions they will have.Dashboard Layout and Functionality: More specifics on the tables, graphs, and filtering.Admin Site Functionality: What actions Garvey needs to perform in the admin interface.
